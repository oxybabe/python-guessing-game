# Number Guesser Game

Would you like to play a game? Let's build a game of "hot and cold" with a random number. Each "level" of this assignment changes the approach needed, so you'll get plenty of problem-solving practice.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to...

* Write simple CLI applications in Python
* Compare & contrast Python syntax & functionality with JavaScript
* Use Python loops and flow control to manage a user's experience

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing four Python scripts (files with a `.py` extension)

## I'm a Python Developer Mode

_Please fork this repo & complete each level in separate script file. Name each file in a way that makes the level clear (ex: `level_1.py`). Hint: you will need to search for how to generate a random number in Python._

### Level One
In level one, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10 and the user has 3 guesses to pick the correct number. The computer will tell you if you are too high or too low.

### Level Two
In level two, the game is reversed and the user picks a number between 1 and 10. The computer then has 3 guesses to select the correct answer. The user will tell the computer if they are correct or incorrect.

### Level Three
In level three, the computer's guesses are optimized to refine each guess based on whether the previous guess was too high or too low. Print how many guesses it takes the computer before it correctly guesses the number.

### Level Four
In level four, give the user an option to play against the computer or to think of a number for the computer to guess.
